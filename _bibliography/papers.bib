  abstract    = {Shuffling one's genetic material with another individual seems a risky endeavor more likely to decrease than to increase offspring fitness. This intuitive argument is commonly employed to explain why the ubiquity of sex and recombination in nature is enigmatic. It is predicated on the notion that natural selection assembles selectively well-matched combinations of genes that recombination would break up resulting in low-fitness offspring - a notion often stated in the literature as a self-evident premise. We show however that, upon closer examination, this premise is flawed: we find to the contrary that natural selection in fact has an encompassing tendency to assemble selectively mismatched gene combinations; recombination breaks up these selectively mismatched combinations (on average), assembles selectively matched combinations, and should thus be favored. The new perspective our findings offer suggests that sex and recombination are not so enigmatic but are instead unavoidable byproducts of natural selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The crucial dependence structure (attraction or repulsiveness) of a critical point process is discussed in depth. We propose simulation strategies based on spectral methods or smoothing of grid-based simulations and show that resulting approximate critical point process simulations asymptotically converge to the exact critical point process distribution. Finally, under the increasing domain framework, we obtain asymptotic results for linear and bilinear statistics of a critical point process. In particular, we obtain a multivariate central limit theorem for the intensity parameter estimate and a modified version of Ripley's K-function.},
