In terms of applications, I am focusing on neuroscience modelling and data analysis. Recently, I am looking for more concrete research areas. In that respect, I am turning to open-source software and the Julia programming language to develop simulation algorithms and produce illustrations of mathematical results.</p> </body></html>
