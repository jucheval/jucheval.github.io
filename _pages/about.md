I have been an assistant professor in applied mathematics since 2017 (sabbatical since September 2025) in [LJK](https://www-ljk.imag.fr) at [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr).

My research interests are partial differential equations, statistics and mainly probabilities. In terms of applications, I am focusing on neuroscience modelling and data analysis. Recently, I am looking for more concrete research areas. In that respect, I am turning to open-source software and the Julia programming language to develop simulation algorithms and produce illustrations of mathematical results.
